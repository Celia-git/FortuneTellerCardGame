#Instructions:

##Card Game
- draw a card
	- get an extra card after scoring last turn
	- if you have enough cards, your drawn card will be discarded
- Exchange cards with the dealer: tap the cards in both rows and click the right purple button with the swap symbol on it
   each blue card is worth 1 pt
   each purple card is worth 2 pt
   each gold card is worth 4 pt
   exchange any combination of cards with the dealer's cards amounting to the same pts
	or
- Make a combo: tap three of your own cards and click the middle purple button with the triangle on it
   each combo consists of one card of each color (they get discarded)
   you will get a figure of the combo made
   you will get +1 draw bonus next turn

- At the end of the turn, you may be required to discard a card

- The dealer is also drawing and discarding cards at random

- The joker has an exchange rate of 4 points and does not appear in discard

### Special Actions (do not count as taking a turn):
- If any of the following are true:
	- you have 3 of the exact same cards
	- you have a "Joker" card
	- you have a one card hand
	then the player may click the left purple button with the star to make a special action.
- A special action can be one of the following:
	- switch whole hands with the dealer
	- get a random gold card from within the deck
	- select any card of your choice from the discard pile

###  Combo Streaks
- When you win a combo, you start on a 'combo streak', as indicated by the icons in the top-right
- Continue the streak by matching new combos with one of the same cards in the next turn
- Win a streak by completing: 
	- 2 combos in a row- same gold card
	- 3 combos in a row- same purple card
	- 4 combos in a row- same blue card
- The streak is broken by exchanging cards next turn or making a different combo
- If the streak is completed, you get a draw token that can be clicked at any point to give a
  draw bonus (depends on the number on the token) for the next draw.

### Achievements
- As you create combos, you may unlock an achievement, which are shown in the dropdown menu at the 
top of the screen
	-- ie: if you match the purple card "Mother" and the blue card "Warrior" with each of the 
		gold cards, "Fire", "Water", and "Stone", you unlock the "Mother Warrior" achievement.
